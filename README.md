# Wix CLI App Templates

[Wix apps](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps) enhance the functionality of Wix sites by adding new features such as custom pages, dashboard components, third-party integrations, or site analytics.

This repo contains templates you can use to rapidly get started building your own Wix app.

## Why start with a template?

Starting with an app template fast-tracks the development process, providing a working foundational app that developers can modify and build upon. This approach saves valuable time, allowing for a quick transition from a concept to a fully functional app.

Wix app templates showcase a variety of features that apps can add to Wix sites, such as:

+ Live site widgets.
+ Dashboard pages or components for site admins.
+ Integration with 3rd-party services.
+ Live site background scripts for analytics and other purposes.

## The templates in this repo

The app templates in this repo use the [Wix CLI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/cli/get-started/about-the-wix-cli-for-apps) and [JavaScript SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk). These tools provide a comprehensive developer experience with minimal setup, so you can focus on coding your Wix app.

The repo contains the following app templates to get you started:

+ [Custom Products Catalog](./custom-products-catalog/README.md)
+ [Mixpanel Analytics](./mixpanel-analytics/README.md)
